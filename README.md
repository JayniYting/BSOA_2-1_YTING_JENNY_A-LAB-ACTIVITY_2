\# LAB ACTIVITY 2

\## BUILDING A SIMPLE OFFICE EVENT WEBSITE



\### QUESTIONS:

1. What did you learn about how WordPress stores its files and data?

2\. Which part was more complex, handling files or managing the database?

3\. Why is version control useful for a WordPress project in an office setting?



\### ANSWERS:

1. I learned that WordPress stores its file and data separately. The files are stored in the WordPress folders inside the htdocs, while the data is stored in the MySQL database. The files control how the website looks and functions, while the database holds the actual content and setting. Both must be connected properly for WordPress to work.

2\. The most complex part was managing the database, especially when creating and linking it with WordPress. Sometimes connection errors appear if the database name, username or password does not match. Handling files was easier because it only involved copying and placing the WordPress folder in the correct directory.

3\. Version control, like Git and GitHub, is useful in an office setting because it helps track every change made to the project. It allows multiple team members to work on a website at the same time without losing progress. If an error happens, previous versions can be restored easily. It also makes collaboration more organized and efficient.
